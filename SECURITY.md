# Security Policy

It is quite literally a feature of this package to be [insecure](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html), by storing passwords in plain-text.

As this package is explicitly designed *not* to be used in production, it's safe to ignore [responsible disclosure](https://www.bugcrowd.com/resource/what-is-responsible-disclosure/) and raise security concerns as regular issues.
